# Databases - NTUA 
This is a repository that contains all the code written for the Semester Project done for the course Introduction to Databases of the 6th Semester of ECE NTUA(2019-2020). \
The aim of the project was to depict a fully organised Database of a Super Market which would serve both the owners and the customers of it. \
We created a database containing info about the customers,products,stores e.t.c using `MySQL 8.0` and `MySQLWorkbench`. \
For the client-server communication we used `Apache Web Server`, for the server side we used `PHP` and `PHPMyAdmin` and for the client side (UI) we used mainly `HTML` and some `JavaScript`(diagrams). We also used `CSS` for the styling of our application.\
